        <p>The idea behind Taylor series is rather simple. Instead of dealing with a particular function in its exact form, we will write it as a polynomial function. Using our knowledge in polynomial, we have more mathematical tools to analyze and manipulate our function. However, as you noted in the graph to the left, the polynomial is only correct within a small range of the function, around the point at which the function is evaluated. But this is good enough for many applications! When we are only concerned with the behavior of the function at a particular point, Taylor series provides a simple solution to our problem.</p>
        <p>The mathematics behind Taylor series is also simple. To mimic the behavior of a function, the polynomial must have the same function value at that point, same first derivative value at that point, same second derivative value at that point. In other words, given a polynomial:</p>
        $$p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$$
        <p>We want to evaluate this function at a particular point. We can do a horizontal shift to that point:</p>
        $$p(x) =  a_n(x-x_0)^n + a_{n-1}(x-x_0)^{n-1} + \dots + a_1(x-x_0) + a_0$$
        <p>Function value at that point must be the same:</p>
        $$f(x_0) = p(x_0) = a_0$$
        <p>First derivative at that point must be the same:</p>
        $$f'(x_0) = p'(x_0) = 1\times a_1$$
        <p>Second derivative at that point must be the same:</p>
        $$f''(x_0) = p''(x_0) = 1.2\times a_2$$
        <p>Third derivative at that point must be the same:</p>
        $$f'''(x_0) = p'''(x_0) = 1.2.3\times a_3$$
        <p>Aha, we can already see a pattern. In general, the nth derivative at that point must be the same, giving us this relation:</p>
        $$f^{(n)}(x_0) = p^{(n)}(x_0) = n! \times a_n$$
        <p>Rearrange the terms, we have the formula to calculate the coefficients for the Taylor series:</p>
        $$a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}$$
        <p>Our Taylor series will become:</p>
        $$p(x) = f(x_0) + \frac{f'(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^2 + \dots$$
        <p>Note that this series goes to infinity:</p>
        $$p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!} (x-x_0)^n$$
        
        <p>Given a known function, we can always compute its derivatives at a certain point. For a function with a formula (in elementary mathematical functions), it is possible to find an expression for its derivatives. Thus, it is always possible to construct the Taylor series for a given function.</p>
